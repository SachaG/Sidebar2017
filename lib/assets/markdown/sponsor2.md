### What People Are Saying

> “The campaign was pretty much **one of the best we have ever run**. Overall it’s highly likely we will have a very fast ROI for this campaign, which in our experience is quite rare.”

<cite>Matt Milosavljevic, [BugHerd](http://bugherd.com)</cite>

> “[The sponsorship] ended up breaking even on the cost vs. revenue. **Having broken even is really good**, given my previous experience with other lists that have 50K-100K users that we spent thousands of dollars to promote on and didn’t get much return from.”

<cite>Amir Khella, [Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/)</cite>

> Sidebar was brilliant, the audience is perfect for our product and **we got a huge bump in signups**. What's also interesting is that it spurred several blog posts about Marvel from design and tech authors who are subscribed to the email.

> Thanks to Sidebar readers, I reached new users and **got a lot of exposure on Twitter** and other sites. Sponsoring Sidebar was one of my best investments.

<cite>Carlos Alvarez, [Black Tie](http://www.blacktie.co)</cite>

> The immediate income from promoting Workshop on Sidebar is already **3x the posting fee**.
