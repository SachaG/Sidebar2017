If you've got a great product and you think the Sidebar audience should know about it, you can sponsor the site for one week.

### Details

Sponsored links are included in the following places:

- In one edition of the daily newsletter (~40k subscribers).
- On the homepage for one day (~1.5k uniques/day).
- In Sidebar's [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/sidebario) (~22k followers).
- On Sidebar's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SidebarIO) (2.3k likes).

Sponsored links can get anywhere from 2k to 4k click-through depending on the content. 

### Guidelines

Sponsored links should be relevant to Sidebar's design-focused audience and link to high-quality, well-designed content. Also, if you would like to take out multiple links for the same product, please make sure they are at least one month apart each. 

### Approval

After you complete the payment, your sponsored link will be reviewed to see if it matches up well with Sidebar's audience. In case it doesn't, you will be fully refunded within a week. 

### Refunds

Sponsorships can be refunded any time up to two weeks before the scheduled date by emailing [sponsor@sidebar.io](mailto:sponsor@sidebar.io).
